            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Lindsey! I'm 27 years old and originally from the Chicagoland area. In 2019, I moved to
                sunny
                Florida for a change of weather and scenery! I loved living there, and as much as I miss Disney and the
                beautiful weather, I now call Virginia home. Life has taken me on quite a journey, and I love exploring
                new places along the way. </p>
            <p>
                For years, I worked in veterinary medicine, driven by my passion for helping animals. While I loved the
                experience, I recently made the exciting leap into software engineering! Learning to code has been both
                a challenge and an adventure, and I can not wait to build a future in tech where I can solve problems
                and
                create meaningful projects. Stay tuned! Projects coming soon!
            </p>
            <p>I have a wonderful little companion that I spend as much time with as I can! My cat, Charlie. I rescued
                him through an organization called Pilots N Paws, where I volunteered. I even flew to Fort Lauderdale to
                pick up three kittens that had been left behind in a hurricane. I definitely did not plan on coming home
                with a new baby, but when I saw Charlies face, I just could not say no. He has been my little buddy for
                four years now, and I would not change that for anything in the world.

            </P>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include reading, crocheting, photography, and cooking.</p>
            <p>I love getting lost in a good book, especially in the worlds of romance, fantasy, or mystery. I also
                enjoy the occasional non-fiction read, depending on my mood. My goal this year is to read 25 books, but
                if I surpass that, I will be more than happy! Two of my all-time favorite books are A Court of Thorns
                and
                Roses (ACOTAR) and From Blood and Ash.</p>
            <p>Crocheting is another hobby I picked up in 2020 during COVID when I started making Christmas presents. I
                taught myself through YouTube tutorials, and since then, I have made blankets, soap holders, and small
                crochet characters. I have even thought about opening an Etsy store, but I have not quite built up the
                confidence—yet!</p>
            <p>Back in high school, I dreamed of becoming a photographer. While I chose a different career path,
                photography has remained one of my favorite creative outlets. I love capturing moments and experimenting
                with different styles, whether it is nature, portraits, or candid everyday shots.</p>
            <p>Cooking is another passion of mine that started in childhood. I always loved helping my mom in the
                kitchen, and in high school, I took three years of cooking classes (mostly because I got to eat during
                class!). I love trying out new recipes and putting my own twist on them. The best part is sharing the
                finished dish with family and friends and seeing them enjoy it!</p>

            <h2>Favorites</h2>
            <p>When it comes to music, I love artists who bring a mix of emotion and energy to their songs. Some of my
                favorites include Noah Kahan, Alex Warren, Benson Boone, Greta Van Fleet, and Cage the Elephant. Music
                is a huge part of my daily life, whether I am relaxing, working, or just vibing. I am also a big movie
                fan, with Studio Ghibli films holding a special place in my heart. The Nightmare Before Christmas is
                another favorite—especially Oogie Boogie! I also never get tired of watching The Mummy and Shrek.</p>
            <p>My love for Pokémon started early, and my favorites have always been Charmander and Ditto. And of course,
                I can not forget Disney! I have been going to Disney World since I was young, and it has always felt
                like a
                second home. Tinkerbell and Tiana are two of my favorite characters, and Cars will always be one of my
                top comfort movies. There is just something magical about Disney that never fades, no matter how many
                times I visit!</p>
